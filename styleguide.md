Style guide Coding The Humanities

-	Tone of voice: Always keep in mind that this is an academic learning environment, so avoid slang and words used in spoken language like stuff and things. However, a contained dose of creative and witty writing every now and then can be agreeable, especially when the subject matter is getting complicated and some motivation is needed.

-	Avoid referring to thing with this / that / etc.

-	Avoid abbreviations, use 'it is' and 'do not' instead of 'it's' and 'don't'.

-	Watch metadata / filenames. Currently, there is not one (!) that is completely correct.

-	Basic syntax in yaml: the right symbol to use for one paragraph is this: >

-	 Watch the 80 char line limit.

-	Never use first person singular (I) and avoid the second person antonym (you) when possible.

-	The titles of the tasks should be written in imperative voice, so Discovering DOM should be Discover DOM.

-	Do not refer back to previous tasks / assignments.

-	The plural for nouns is with an s at the end without apostrophe. Example: one photo, two photos. An apostrophe indicates the genitive case: this documentâ€™s structure.

-	Be more consistent using jargon in one YAML (so only use "web components" and do not mix it with "Web Components", "webcomponents" etc).

-	Nouns in (objective and task) titles should be capitalized.

- 	First letter of a brand name should always be capitalized (for example: Google Maps).

-	Objective titles need to be a lot more concise! 

-	Write shorter paragraphs. We will come with a fixed word limit for tasks and descriptions.
